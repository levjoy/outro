Outro is a band of indie rock veterans out of western MA who have been playing loud music in front of people for a collective total of 92 years. Its DNA is spliced out of local bands including Psychic Energy, the Capitulators, Mobius Band, the Lucky Shots, and Bring it to Bear. Mixing elements of the melodic psych-rock and off-kilter punk of bands like Deerhunter, Bedhead, Built to Spill, and the Feelies, the band has released an EP and will record its first full-length the fall of 2022.
